## Introduction

Multi-agent language models (MALM) are a promising approach to generating human-like conversations and understanding educational content. By leveraging the power of multiple language models, MALM can capture the nuances of human communication and provide more accurate and context-aware responses.

## Project Structure

The project is organized as follows:

- `expirements`: Contains the implementation of the multi-agent language models.

## Experiments

The project includes experiments:

### CoderTesterRviewer

The goal of this experiment is to investigate the potential of MALM in generating human-like conversations and understanding educational content related to coding, testing, and code review tasks
